You and me are always
gonna be magnetic
You and me are always
gonna be magnetic
Chew me up and spit me out
'Cause you know
that I'll come back
End to end, we separate
But the emptiness attracts
'Cause I know
Where I shouldn't go
When I feel this low, oh no
This time I can't let go
It's out of my control
No matter how hard I try
You pull me back every time
You try to push away,
but I'm right back at it
'Cause you and me are
always gonna be magnetic
No matter how far I run
One taste and I come undone
You try to push away,
but I'm right back at it
'Cause you and me are
always gonna be magnetic
You and me are always
gonna be magnetic
You and me are always
gonna be magnetic
I pull the strings
that set me free
But the hand above ain't mine
To hell with all
you say and mean
'Cause Heaven knows they lies
And I know
Where I shouldn't go
When I feel this low, oh no
This time I can't let go
No matter how hard I try
You pull me back every time
You try to push away,
but I'm right back at it
'Cause you and me are
always gonna be magnetic
No matter how far I run
One taste and I come undone
You try to push away,
but I'm right back at it
'Cause you and me are
always gonna be magnetic
It's a force we can't escape
We're tied to fate
We're tied to fate
No matter how hard I try
You pull me back every time
You and me are
always gonna be magnetic
No matter how hard I try
You pull me back every time
You try to push away,
but I'm right back at it
'Cause you and me are
always gonna be magnetic
No matter how far I run
One taste and I come undone
You try to push away,
but I'm right back at it
'Cause you and me are
always gonna be magnetic
You and me are
always gonna be magnetic
You and me are
always gonna be magnetic
